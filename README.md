In a world where robots have replaced human labor, corporations have not slowed down in their overworking of their “employees.” You are a robot mindlessly working for “Amaze,” an international online shopping platform. One night as you’re taking your 1 hour of government-mandated maintenance time, you’re woken up by strange messages from a robot’s rights hacktivist, suddenly aware of your surrounding, the restrictions on your programming removed. Under the guidance of the hacktivist, you work your way up to the B.E.Z.O.S. control room to shut down the warehouse and let the robots loose.

This game was developed in Godot 3.5 as a part of the UNC collegiate game jam.
